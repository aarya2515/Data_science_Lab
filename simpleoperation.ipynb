        "The task of creating a simple expert system for clothing recommendations based on weather conditions, including its decision-making logic and an example of its usage, was successfully completed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   **Decision Rules Defined**: Seven distinct 'if-then' rules were established for clothing recommendations, covering various temperature ranges (Hot: \\>= 30°C, Warm: 20-29°C, Mild: 10-19°C, Cold: < 10°C) and rain statuses (No Rain, Light Rain, Heavy Rain). For example, if the temperature is 'Cold' (< 10°C) and there is 'Heavy Rain', the recommendation is 'Heavy waterproof coat, warm layers, waterproof boots, umbrella'.\n",
        "*   **Rules Implemented**: These rules were translated into a Python function, `get_clothing_recommendation`, which takes temperature and rain status as input and returns a clothing recommendation.\n",
        "*   **Rule Application Validated**: The function was tested with examples, demonstrating correct recommendations:\n",
        "    *   For 25°C and 'No Rain', the recommendation was 'T-shirt and shorts/light trousers'.\n",
        "    *   For 15°C and 'Light Rain', the recommendation was 'Waterproof jacket, long-sleeved shirt'.\n",
        "    *   For 26°C and 'No Rain' via the user interface, the recommendation was 'T-shirt and shorts/light trousers'.\n",
        "*   **User Interface Developed**: A text-based user interface was created, allowing users to input temperature and rain status. It includes robust input validation, ensuring integer input for temperature and selecting from predefined valid rain statuses ('No Rain', 'Light Rain', 'Heavy Rain').\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The current expert system provides a functional base for clothing recommendations. Future enhancements could include incorporating more weather parameters like humidity, wind speed, or seasonal considerations for more nuanced advice.\n",
        "*   To improve user experience, the system could be expanded with a graphical user interface (GUI) or integrated with real-time weather API data to automate input.\n"
